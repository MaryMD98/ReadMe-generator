# Homework Unit Nine: Readme Generator

## [Description](#description)

In this homework I created a readme generator to create a high-quality README for a new project. This application uses a command-line that accepts user input. 

The application asks a series of questions to the user to input. After all questions are responded the readme is generated. The readme has a table of contents with links to areas of the readme. The readme has the following sections, title, description, installation, usage, license, sontributing, tests, and questions. When the user choses a type of license, then a badge is generated at the top of the page, and a link to the coresponding license is provided on the license area.

Here is a screencapture video demostrating the functinality of the [application](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/EwMaCsGJX6D2LahB6aA6).
